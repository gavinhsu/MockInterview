Python,"Memory management in Python, for the most part, includes a private pile space, where every one of the information structures and articles is found. Python additionally has an inbuilt city worker that will reuse the unused memory and make it accessible to the load space.",,,,,,
Python,"PYTHONPATH is an environment variable that has a string value, which is added in Python? system directory list as it has a set of directories. PYTHONPATH is generally used when we have not made any installable Python package, but we want to import some code that we have written in a program.",,,,,,
Python,"The most applicable response to this python programming interview question would be that List and Tuple behave almost the same way, and any item stored in a List or Tuple can be accessed by its index. Still, two major differences between them are that List is mutable, but Tuple is immutable, which means, List can be modified, but Tuple cannot be modified. Besides, Lists are slower than Tuples.",,,,,,
Python,"An interpreted language is a language that is read in its raw form, and the statements are executed without being first compiled. Python is an interpreted language as it runs directly from the source code. The source code written by the programmer is first converted into an intermediate language and then to a machine language that has to be executed.

Python,Pickling is a process by which a Python object gets converted into a string via a pickle module. The process then puts it into a file by calling the dump() method.   Whereas unpickling does the reverse of the above-said process. It retrieves the stored string and turns it back into an object.,,,,,,
Python,"Yes, we can preset Pythonpath as a Python installer.",,,,,,
Python,Tuples is a sequence data type in Python. The number of values in tuples are separated by commas.,,,,,,

SQL,A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.,,,,,,
SQL,"The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.
A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns).",,,,,,
SQL,"A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be multiple unique constraints defined per table. The code syntax for UNIQUE is quite similar to that of PRIMARY KEY and can be used interchangeably.",,,,,,
SQL,A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refer to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables.,,,,,,
SQL,"1. Clustered index modifies the way records are stored in a database based on the indexed column. Non-clustered index creates a separate entity within the table which references the original table.

SQL,"A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.",,,,,,
SQL,"Normalization represents the way of organizing structured data in the database efficiently. It includes creation of tables, establishing relationships between them, and defining rules for those relationships. Inconsistency and redundancy can be kept in check based on these rules, hence, adding flexibility to the database.",,,,,,
SQL,"Denormalization is the inverse process of normalization, where the normalized schema is converted into a schema which has redundant information. The performance is improved by using redundancy and keeping the redundant data consistent. The reason for performing denormalization is the overheads produced in query processor by an over-normalized structure.",,,,,,
"SQL
","If a table is dropped, all things associated with the tables are dropped as well. This includes - the relationships defined on the table with other tables, the integrity checks and constraints, access privileges and other grants that the table has. To create and use the table again in its original form, all these relations, checks, constraints, privileges and relationships need to be redefined. However, if a table is truncated, none of the above problems exist and the table retains its original structure.",,,,,,
