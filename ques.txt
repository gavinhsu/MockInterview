What is Functional Decomposition?
A technique used during planning, analysis, and design; creates a functional hierarchy for the software.
What is Integration Testing?
Testing of combined parts of an application to determine if they function together correctly. Usually performed after unit and functional testing. This type of testing is especially relevant to client/server and distributed systems.
What is Metric?
