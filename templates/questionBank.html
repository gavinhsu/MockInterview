                    Stock splits divide a company’s shares into fractions, usually of equal value. This is usually done when the company’s stock price increases significantly. A split ensures that the company’s shares remain affordable and therefore liquid (anyone has the capacity to buy 1 or more shares in the company).
Alternatively, when stock prices drop precipitously to become penny stocks, respectable firms will generally undergo a reverse stock split to stem volatility.

                    Traders are looking for someone intellectually curious who will be engaged with the drivers behind the work. Unlike investment banking which tends to be more regional, markets and products are global and never sleep. No matter where you are in the world, the trading floor is affected by the Federal Reserve, the price of oil and the S&P 500.
As such, the WSJ and Bloomberg are going to be much more relevant than Dealbook. Knowing commodity prices and where the TSX is at is very important when interviewing for a Canadian bank.

                    This is rarely asked on the trading floor now as people have short memories, but for nerdier quant groups, this will come up.
Generally, bubbles occur when investor confidence pushes the price of the securities significantly above its fundamental value. The tech bubble is no different. The term “Irrational Exuberance” was coined by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to describe this phenomenon.
The sentiment behind this bubble was that the growth of companies with any online presence or loose relation would be astronomical, but a realisation that normal valuation principles still applied and that many of these companies had no feasible timeline to profit (or even revenue) resulted in markets receding. Literature suggests that a Barron’s article sparked the reversal.

              A repo (repurchase agreement) is a transaction where the seller of a security reaches an agreement to buy the security from the buyer at a later date for a predetermined price. The seller is effectively a lender, loaning the security to the buyer, the borrower.

            If the interest rate in the U.S. increases, how would this affect the USDCAD exchange rate?
            The US dollar would strengthen relative to the Canadian dollar, holding all other things constant. Investors will pour into a higher yielding asset assuming no significant delta in risk or expected devaluation.
            Empirical evidence suggests that the economy is relatively hotter as well if the central bank is raising rates. Recent Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada actions have supported this.
            You may segue into a discussion on purchasing power parity and expectations where you expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate instead, but do not do that.

Munis do have default risk, as illustrated by the unprecedented recent example of Detroit. That bankruptcy also meant that bond investors had to consider their effective seniority against pensioners and other stakeholders that they ended up ceding haircuts to – influencing the rates lenders are willing to take going forward.

Describe the convexity of a callable bond
Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at lower yields. Convexity is the rate of change of a bond’s duration. As interest rates approach the yield-to-call, the rate of change slows.
A callable bond benefits the bond issuer as it can call or redeem the bond at the issuer’s option for a certain price.

Usually, this happens when interest rates fall and the borrower would benefit from redeeming and reissuing the bond at a lower interest rate. As such, as interest rates fall, the best possible price the bond investor can achieve is the call price.
As a follow up question, an interviewee may be asked about yield to call or how investors need to be compensated for this embedded option (they will need a higher coupon).

      <div class="panel-body">
        An interest rate collar is the simultaneous sale of an interest rate floor and purchase of an interest rate ceiling or cap. Collars are used by fixed income investors to lock in a range of interest rates, which allows for them to be protected from rising rates while giving up the potential benefits of lower interest rates (remember for bonds, lower interest rates means a higher present value of cash flows and vice versa).
The interest rate cap and interest rate floor must both have the same notional principal (the dollar amount to which the contracted terms are relevant to), and the ceiling/cap must be above the floor strike.
The interviewer can subsequently ask about reverse collars or zero cost collars.

        They are terms used to describe the state of the option, namely whether or not the option is worth exercising at the current price of the underlying asset. For call options, when the asset price is above the strike price of the option, the option is in the money. When the asset price is below the strike price, the option is out of the money. For put options, this relationship is simply flipped. For both call options and put options, when the asset price equals the strike price, the option is at the money.
If you are holding a call option on CIBC stock with a strike price of $120 (expiring today), and the stock is currently trading at $100, how much is your option worth? Is it in the money or out of the money?
The option is worth $0, as exercising the option would allow you to buy CIBC stock at $120, and the stock is currently trading at $100. You would incur a loss of $20 if you exercise, therefore you would rather let the option expire. The option is currently out of the money.
