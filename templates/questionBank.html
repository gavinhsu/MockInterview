                    Stock splits divide a company’s shares into fractions, usually of equal value. This is usually done when the company’s stock price increases significantly. A split ensures that the company’s shares remain affordable and therefore liquid (anyone has the capacity to buy 1 or more shares in the company).
Alternatively, when stock prices drop precipitously to become penny stocks, respectable firms will generally undergo a reverse stock split to stem volatility.

                    Stock buybacks are another way for companies to return money to its shareholders by buying back stock in the secondary market. For equity capital markets and equity derivatives you may be expected to know about Normal Course Issuer Bids and Substantial Issuer Bids.

                    Traders are looking for someone intellectually curious who will be engaged with the drivers behind the work. Unlike investment banking which tends to be more regional, markets and products are global and never sleep. No matter where you are in the world, the trading floor is affected by the Federal Reserve, the price of oil and the S&P 500.
As such, the WSJ and Bloomberg are going to be much more relevant than Dealbook. Knowing commodity prices and where the TSX is at is very important when interviewing for a Canadian bank.

                    This is rarely asked on the trading floor now as people have short memories, but for nerdier quant groups, this will come up.
Generally, bubbles occur when investor confidence pushes the price of the securities significantly above its fundamental value. The tech bubble is no different. The term “Irrational Exuberance” was coined by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to describe this phenomenon.
The sentiment behind this bubble was that the growth of companies with any online presence or loose relation would be astronomical, but a realisation that normal valuation principles still applied and that many of these companies had no feasible timeline to profit (or even revenue) resulted in markets receding. Literature suggests that a Barron’s article sparked the reversal.

                    There is no single correct answer to this question. You may want to start with describing your risk tolerance based on your financial position and your expected outlay. Then, based on the current market conditions (stock market, bond market, commodities market), allocate assets based on how far they deviate away from their fundamental levels.
The main thing that the interviewer is looking for is the quality of your thought process and your ability to articulate your ideas.

              A repo (repurchase agreement) is a transaction where the seller of a security reaches an agreement to buy the security from the buyer at a later date for a predetermined price. The seller is effectively a lender, loaning the security to the buyer, the borrower.

            A reverse repo is a transaction where the buyer of the security reaches an agreement to sell the security back to the seller at a later date for a predetermined price. As this is simply the other side of a repo transaction, the lending relationship is the same.

            If the interest rate in the U.S. increases, how would this affect the USDCAD exchange rate?
            The US dollar would strengthen relative to the Canadian dollar, holding all other things constant. Investors will pour into a higher yielding asset assuming no significant delta in risk or expected devaluation.
            Empirical evidence suggests that the economy is relatively hotter as well if the central bank is raising rates. Recent Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada actions have supported this.
            You may segue into a discussion on purchasing power parity and expectations where you expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate instead, but do not do that.

          The decision is largely influenced by the cost of capital, which is partially determined by stock market conditions and interest rates (remember interest expense is tax deductible). Generally, the company will choose the cheaper financing option (however, there are other factors at play, eg. pecking order theory).

        This is more of a Debt Capital Markets question.
        DIP Financing by debtor-in-possession lenders – unique financing method for a company in bankruptcy usually has seniority over all other types of debt
        Senior Secured Debt for secured creditors (a lien on fenced off or circled assets) – bank revolvers and bank debt (term loans), certain bonds
        High yield bonds – for unsecured creditors
        Subordinated debt

These bonds are different in that they are generally tax exempt, which means the attractiveness of Munis is a function of the properties of the bond itself and your individual tax bracket. If you are interviewing with a US bank, you will need to know about tax-exempt yields.
Munis do have default risk, as illustrated by the unprecedented recent example of Detroit. That bankruptcy also meant that bond investors had to consider their effective seniority against pensioners and other stakeholders that they ended up ceding haircuts to – influencing the rates lenders are willing to take going forward.
An interesting development going forward will be the City of Chicago – a far more important city globally, and one that has been recently downgraded to Junk by Moody’s.

Describe the convexity of a callable bond
Callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at lower yields. Convexity is the rate of change of a bond’s duration. As interest rates approach the yield-to-call, the rate of change slows.
A callable bond benefits the bond issuer as it can call or redeem the bond at the issuer’s option for a certain price.

Usually, this happens when interest rates fall and the borrower would benefit from redeeming and reissuing the bond at a lower interest rate. As such, as interest rates fall, the best possible price the bond investor can achieve is the call price.
As a follow up question, an interviewee may be asked about yield to call or how investors need to be compensated for this embedded option (they will need a higher coupon).

        An inverted yield curve describes a yield curve which slopes downward. It is relatively rare as typically, cost of borrowing increases as maturity increases. Yield curves invert when the market expects short-term interest rates to decline, which tends to occur following periods of tight money/credit.

        An interest rate collar is the simultaneous sale of an interest rate floor and purchase of an interest rate ceiling or cap. Collars are used by fixed income investors to lock in a range of interest rates, which allows for them to be protected from rising rates while giving up the potential benefits of lower interest rates (remember for bonds, lower interest rates means a higher present value of cash flows and vice versa).
The interest rate cap and interest rate floor must both have the same notional principal (the dollar amount to which the contracted terms are relevant to), and the ceiling/cap must be above the floor strike.
The interviewer can subsequently ask about reverse collars or zero cost collars.

        They are terms used to describe the state of the option, namely whether or not the option is worth exercising at the current price of the underlying asset. For call options, when the asset price is above the strike price of the option, the option is in the money. When the asset price is below the strike price, the option is out of the money. For put options, this relationship is simply flipped. For both call options and put options, when the asset price equals the strike price, the option is at the money.
If you are holding a call option on CIBC stock with a strike price of $120 (expiring today), and the stock is currently trading at $100, how much is your option worth? Is it in the money or out of the money?
The option is worth $0, as exercising the option would allow you to buy CIBC stock at $120, and the stock is currently trading at $100. You would incur a loss of $20 if you exercise, therefore you would rather let the option expire. The option is currently out of the money.

      DDR2 is the successor to DDR RAM. DDR 2 incorporates several technological upgrades to computer system memory, as well as an enhanced data rate.DDR 2 is capable of achieving twice the data transfer rate of DDR-I memory because of its higher clock speed. It operates at a lower voltage than DDR-I as well: 1.8 volts instead of 2.5.
