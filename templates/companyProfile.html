    <p class="description">Morgan Stanley is a financial services corporation that, through its affiliates and subsidiaries, advises, and originates, trades, manages, and distributes capital for institutions, governments, and individuals. The company operates in three business segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.<br>
    Morgan Stanley was formed as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act that required United States banks to separate their investment banking and commercial banking businesses. It followed the Great Depression when there were a series of bank runs, and commercial banks were accused of taking too many risks using depositors’ funds. When J.P. Morgan chose to continue with commercial banking, some of its employees, notably Henry S. Morgan and Harold Stanley, left the company to start an investment banking company.</p>

It is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip manufacturer based on revenue,[4][5] and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).<br>
    Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.<br>
    Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968 by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore (of Moore's law), and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the integrated circuit (the microchip). The fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate.</p>

    <p class="description">Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers.<br>
    Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[6] followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.</p>

    <p class="description">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is one of Taiwan's largest companies, the world's most valuable semiconductor company, and the world's largest dedicated independent (pure-play) semiconductor foundry, with its headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. TSMC has a global capacity of about 13 million 300 mm (12 in) equivalent wafers per year as of 2020, and makes microchips for customers with process nodes from 2 micron to 7 nanometers. TSMC is the first foundry to provide 7 nanometer production capabilities and the first to commercialize extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology in high volume.<br>
        TSMC’s N7+ is the first commercially available extreme ultraviolet lithographic process in the semiconductor industry. It uses ultraviolet patterning and enables more acute circuits to be implemented on the silicon. Compared with the previous technology node, N7+ offers a 15-20% higher transistor density and 10% reduction in power consumption. The volume increase TSMC managed from the N7 was the fastest ever to meet time to market, faster than 10nm and 16nm. The N5 iteration doubles transistor density and improves performance by an additional 15%.</p>
